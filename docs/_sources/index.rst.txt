Welcome to the NHERI-SimCenter 2022 Programming Bootcamp
========================================================

Following the success of our online version of this workshop,
this year's **offering will be solely online**.  Expect to collaborate with 
students from across the globe and enjoy the oportunity to make new friends
at unexpected places.

**The format** will be two weeks of daily self-study assignments, followed by three (3) hours of
online lectures and exercises via zoom, followed by homework assignments and some more self-study 
video sessions.
Every morning, office hours are held for one (1) hour before
the actual meetings.

These two weeks are offered as individual or as one combined workshop as follows.

1. Python Workshop

   * **Mon June 13 - Friday, June 17, 2022**

   The Python workshop is geared towards beginner and intermediate level material.
   The first three days will cover and refresh basic concepts of python, 
   as well as fundamentals of code design.
   Thursday will transition you to command-line use of python, as you'll need on any 
   high-performance computing (HPC) environment. 
   The workship will conclude on Friday with a team coding challange that emphasizes on
   collaborative coding and computing.



2. C/C++/HPC Workshop 

   * **Mon July 18 - Friday, July 22, 2022**

   The second week of this workshop is all focused on HPC target environments,
   reviewing codings basiscs in C and C++, but quickly transitioning to the fundamentals of
   parallel programming.  While we will review the fundamentals, this week is geared towards
   students with at least intermediate coding experience in a language such as python or
   C/C++.  We do not recommend taking this part without any prior experience.
